**The Loop of Progress Starts Here!** This repository contains the code for the [mobius-robotics.github.io](https://mobius-robotics.github.io/) website, showcasing our Robotics Team's journey and achievements. The site highlights what we do, the projects we've worked on, the events we've participated in, our robots, and a gallery showcasing team photos. Key sections include: 
 
- **Eurobot**: Our journey in the competition.  
- **Loki and Dinamino**: Detailed descriptions of our robots.  
- **Gallery**: A collection of team pictures.  

The website features a clean layout, a theme toggle (light/dark), and colors inspired by our logo. It's hosted on GitHub Pages and styled with TailwindCSS and DaisyUI.
